# WriteUps
A few write-ups about HTB machines.
I try to be beginner oriented, and I try to write everything I try when I'm hacking the box.

I remember when I started that it seemed so easy for others, because write-ups only contained the successful attempt, and hid the research part. It was more about reporting the issue like when doing a pentest that showing a methodology, and trying to demonstrate the mindset you need to complete this challenge.
I hope my write-ups won't have this issue. Enjoy !

To use, just check the <name_of_the_folder>.md file.
